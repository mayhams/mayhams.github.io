leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked
by a wall.

</span><span class="white">Mayhem originally consisted of the intentional and wanton removal of a body
part that would handicap a person's ability to defend themself in combat.
Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to
an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not
sufficiently disabling.  Later the meaning of the crime expanded to
encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any
instrument.

of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked

</span><span class="white">The only interesting thing other than the buildings surrounding the edges
of the courtyard stands to the north in the form of an ornate fountain that
supplies the residents of this area with a source of water. There is a door
past the font that has more elaborate designs upon it than any others here.
Looking to the northwest, two doors can be seen standing adjacent to each
other with similar, yet varied designs marking them both. Another street
leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked
by a wall.

</span><span class="white">The only interesting thing other than the buildings surrounding the edges
of the courtyard stands to the north in the form of an ornate fountain that
supplies the residents of this area with a source of water. There is a door
past the font that has more elaborate designs upon it than any others here.
Looking to the northwest, two doors can be seen standing adjacent to each
other with similar, yet varied designs marking them both. Another street
leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked
by a wall.

Looking to the northwest, two doors can be seen standing adjacent to each

leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked

</span><span class="white">The only interesting thing other than the buildings surrounding the edges
of the courtyard stands to the north in the form of an ornate fountain that
supplies the residents of this area with a source of water. There is a door
past the font that has more elaborate designs upon it than any others here.
Looking to the northwest, two doors can be seen standing adjacent to each
other with similar, yet varied designs marking them both. Another street
leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked
by a wall.

</span><span class="bwhite">Ritterholm Central Courtyard
</span><span class="white">The only interesting thing other than the buildings surrounding the edges
of the courtyard stands to the north in the form of an ornate fountain that
supplies the residents of this area with a source of water. There is a door
past the font that has more elaborate designs upon it than any others here.
Looking to the northwest, two doors can be seen standing adjacent to each
other with similar, yet varied designs marking them both. Another street
leading out of the city lies on the west side of a house that forms a wall
of the yard and extends east past the marker and out of visibility, blocked
by a wall.
